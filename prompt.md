You are an experienced backend Go developer. Build a production-quality Event Registration & Ticketing REST API (like Eventbrite) using Go and PostgreSQL, following industry-standard layered architecture (handler → service → repository), clean project structure, proper transaction management with pgx, and concurrency-safe booking using SELECT FOR UPDATE. The system must prevent overbooking under concurrent requests and include a goroutine-based concurrent booking test to prove correctness.

Serve minimal static HTML pages (no frontend frameworks) from the Go server to create events, view events, and register users. Include proper database constraints, meaningful HTTP status codes, and clear documentation (README + DESIGN) explaining race conditions, pessimistic locking, architectural decisions, tradeoffs, and scalability considerations. The entire scope should be realistic to complete within one day while still demonstrating production-level design practices.
